# EasyAbuse

## Introduction
I deal with AbuseIPDB on a daily basis with my work. Traditionally I'd just go to their website and submit the IPs that way. I figured I would make it easier for folks that may not be very technical (though I know this is a SUPER basic program). 

## Requirements 
*Python3
## Installation / Use

Either download the zip or fetch it. 
```
git clone https://github.com/bsmith14843/EasyAbuse
```
After downloading it open it in your text editor of choice. Place your API key from AbuseIPDB in the placeholder 

```
api_param = "[API]" #Enter your API Key here
```
Open Terminal
```
python3 EasyAbuse.py
```

## Future Goals
Though I know this is a super basic program, I do plan on eventually adding some pieces. Hopefully something to report the IPs. I'm open to suggestions. 

## Notes
I'm not a programmer by any means :)
